# Lead Scoring 

This is a backend service built for lead scoring. It accepts product details and a CSV of business leads, then scores each lead's buying intent using a hybrid model that combines a rule-based engine and AI-powered reasoning from the Google Gemini API. The service is built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, and is deployed on Render.

## üìù API Endpoints Documentation

Here is a complete guide to using the API, similar to a Postman collection.

### 1. Set Offer Details

This endpoint saves the product/offer details that will be used for scoring the leads. It overwrites any previously saved offer.

* **Endpoint**: `POST /offer`
* **Request Body**: `JSON`
    ```json
    {
      "name": "AI Outreach Automation",
      "value_props": ["24/7 outreach", "6x more meetings"],
      "ideal_use_cases": ["B2B SaaS", "Fintech"]
    }
    ```
* **cURL Example**:
    ```bash
    curl -X POST [https://lead-scoring-1.onrender.com/api/v1/offer](https://lead-scoring-1.onrender.com/api/v1/offer) \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
      "name": "AI Outreach Automation",
      "value_props": ["24/7 outreach", "6x more meetings"],
      "ideal_use_cases": ["B2B SaaS", "Fintech"]
    }'
    ```

### 2. Upload Leads CSV

This endpoint accepts a CSV file containing leads. It clears any previously uploaded leads and results.

* **Endpoint**: `POST /leads/upload`
* it should be like <img width="1338" height="182" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/52313a05-a50a-4ad1-9fb6-dd551a9bc096" />

* **Request Body**: `form-data`
    * **Key**: `file`
    * **Value**: Your `.csv` file. The CSV must have the columns: `name,role,company,industry,location,linkedin_bio`.
* **cURL Example**:
    ```bash
   https://lead-scoring-1.onrender.com/api/v1/leads/upload
    ```

### 3. Run Scoring Process

This endpoint triggers the scoring pipeline. It processes all uploaded leads against the saved offer and saves the results to the database.

* **Endpoint**: `POST /score`
* **cURL Example**:
    ```bash
   https://lead-scoring-1.onrender.com/api/v1/score
    ```

### 4. Get Scored Results (JSON)

This endpoint retrieves the list of all scored leads in JSON format.

* **Endpoint**: `GET /results`
* **cURL Example**:
    ```bash
   https://lead-scoring-1.onrender.com/api/v1/results
    ```

### 5. Export Results as CSV (Bonus)

This endpoint downloads the scored results as a `scored_leads.csv` file.

* **Endpoint**: `GET /results/export`
* **cURL Example**:
    ```bash
    # This command downloads the file and saves it as scored_leads.csv
    https://lead-scoring-1.onrender.com/api/v1/results/export
    ```

### 6. Reset Database

This utility endpoint clears all data from the `offers`, `leads`, and `scoredLeads` collections.

* **Endpoint**: `POST /reset`
* **cURL Example**:
    ```bash
   https://lead-scoring-1.onrender.com/api/v1/reset
    ```

## Scoring Logic Explanation

Each lead is scored out of 100 points, broken down into two layers:

### Rule Layer (Max 50 Points)
* **Role Relevance (20 pts)**: `+20` for decision-makers (e.g., CEO, VP, Head of), `+10` for influencers (e.g., Manager, Senior).
* **Industry Match (20 pts)**: `+20` if the lead's industry is an ideal match based on the offer's `ideal_use_cases`.
* **Data Completeness (10 pts)**: `+10` if all required fields in the lead's data are present and not empty.

### AI Layer (Max 50 Points)
* The service sends the offer details and the lead's profile to the **Google Gemini** model.
* The prompt asks the AI to classify the lead's buying intent as **High, Medium, or Low** and provide a brief justification.
* The AI's response is mapped to points: `High` = 50, `Medium` = 30, `Low` = 10.

**Final Score = `rule_score` + `ai_points`**
